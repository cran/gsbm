## The network of contacts in a primary school

The network of contacts in a primary school was collected an first analyzed in "High-Resolution Measurements of Face-to-Face Contact Patterns in a Primary School" by J. Stehl√© et al. in PLOS ONE (2011). This data set records physical interactions between $226$ children and $10$ teachers from the same primary school over the course of a day. The network data was collected using a system of sensors worn by the participants. This system records the duration of interactions between two individuals facing each other at a maximum distance of one and a half meters.
